<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Sherryl from a place on the earth. Living as a resident in my home town. As I'm speaking here today, I just want to share about my life story. It has always been a secret.</p>

<p>I'm a shy person, who doesn't talk much. Yeah, you're right. I'm an Introvert. But I can be an extra extrovert sometimes.</p>

<p>Talking about my childhood, I was a child. I was 5 years old. I was also a child who was born at a very young age. Life was hard. I could not see my own forehead. I was running for my life, when the dog started chasing after me. And that became a nightmare of my life. Life was so scary whenever I see a dog in the same street as I am.</p>
<p>But in the end we need to fight for our lives inorder to not get caught by the street dogs.</p>
<p>So live your life without getting caught to a dog.</p>
